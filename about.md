Hi there! Welcome to GU-CS-Notes!
</p>

## About GU-CS-Notes
This is a project for creating a collaborative set of notes for lectures. A class of people can all contribute and edit each other's notes through the year in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). At the end of it all, exams come around and everyone's lecture notes are freely available in a pretty format online for the class to use. 

Specifically, this project is aimed at the Level 4 Computing Science students for Glasgow University.
